title: Memo Program
---

The Memo program is a simple program that validates a string of UTF-8 encoded
characters and verifies that any accounts provided are signers of the
transaction. The program also logs the memo, as well as any verified signer
addresses, to the transaction log, so that anyone can easily observe memos and
know they were approved by zero or more addresses by inspecting the transaction
log from a trusted provider.

## Background

Solana's programming model and the definitions of the Solana terms used in this
document are available at:

- https://docs.solana.com/apps
- https://docs.solana.com/terminology

## Source

The Memo Program's source is available on
[github](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library)

## Interface

The on-chain Memo Program is written in Rust and available on crates.io as
[spl-memo](https://crates.io/crates/spl-memo) and
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/spl-memo).

The crate provides a `build_memo()` method to easily create a properly
constructed Instruction.

## Operational Notes

If zero accounts are provided to the signed-memo instruction, the program
succeeds when the memo is valid UTF-8, and logs the memo to the transaction log.

If one or more accounts are provided to the signed-memo instruction, all must be
valid signers of the transaction for the instruction to succeed.

### Logs

This section details expected log output for memo instructions.

Logging begins with entry into the program:
`Program MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr invoke [1]`

The program will include a separate log for each verified signer:
`Program log: Signed by <BASE_58_ADDRESS>`

Then the program logs the memo length and UTF-8 text:
`Program log: Memo (len 4): "üêÜ"`

If UTF-8 parsing fails, the program will log the failure point:
`Program log: Invalid UTF-8, from byte 4`

Logging ends with the status of the instruction, one of:
`Program MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr success`
`Program MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr failed: missing required signature for instruction`
`Program MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr failed: invalid instruction data`

### Compute Limits

Like all programs, the Memo Program is subject to the cluster's [compute
budget](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#compute-budget).
In Memo, compute is used for parsing UTF-8, verifying signers, and logging,
limiting the memo length and number of signers that can be processed
successfully in a single instruction. The longer or more complex the UTF-8 memo,
the fewer signers can be supported, and vice versa.

As of v1.5.1, an unsigned instruction can support single-byte UTF-8 of up to 566
bytes. An instruction with a simple memo of 32 bytes can support up to 12
signers.
